# Reel_Capacity
This app which you can find its apk file in Extras folder is written using Eclipse/Java to calculate the Reel/Drum Capacity. This app can help anyone who works in a cable manufacturing company.
I built this app on November 2013 when I was working for "Moghan Wire and Cable" company. http://moghancableco.com/new/index.php/en/
